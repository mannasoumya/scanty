# Hello! scanty is here
## A basic Console Client written in Python for Windows
### Double-Click on the Executable(scanty.exe) to Run

#### Currently supported commands:
```console
cat
cd
cls
commands
exit
help
history
ls
lsdir
mkdir
pwd

```

#### TODO:

*I: Tab completion of commands and arguments*

*II: Redirecting standard output to file using the '>' and appending to file using '>>' operator*

*III: Commands*
```console
cp
mv
grep
rm
.\*.exe
.... suggest more here
```

*IV: Refactoring*

Rewriting using **python-prompt-toolkit** found <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit">here</a>.
Maybe console colors someday

*Pull requests are welcome*
